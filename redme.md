# Application Setup Instructions

To run this application, please follow the steps below to install and configure the necessary software and dependencies. Note that while this guide includes all common requirements, specific applications may only use a subset of these libraries.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following software installed and configured correctly:

1. **Apache Tomcat**
2. **MySQL Database**
3. **MySQL Connector**
4. **Servlet API**
5. **Apache Commons File Upload and Commons IO libraries**
6. **Gson Library**

## Setup Steps

### 1. Install Apache Tomcat Server
- Download and install the Apache Tomcat server from the official [Apache Tomcat website](https://tomcat.apache.org/).
- Make sure Tomcat is correctly configured to serve your web applications.

### 2. Install MySQL and Create Databases
- Download and install MySQL from the official [MySQL website](https://www.mysql.com/).
- After installation, create the necessary databases for this application using MySQL.

### 3. Install MySQL Connector
- Download the MySQL Connector JAR file.
- Move the downloaded JAR file into the `lib` folder within your Tomcat installation (typically found at `TOMCAT_HOME/lib`).

### 4. Set Environment Variable for Servlet API
- Configure an environment variable to point to the Servlet API JAR file located in the `TOMCAT_HOME/lib` folder.
- This is essential for running Java Servlets and accessing the Servlet API.

### 5. Set Environment Variables for Apache Commons Libraries
- Download the required JAR files for Apache Commons File Upload and Commons IO.
- Place these JAR files into the `TOMCAT_HOME/lib` folder.
- Set environment variables to reference these files, enabling proper handling of file uploads and input/output operations.

### 6. Download and Configure Gson Library
- Download the Gson library from a reliable source, extract the JAR file, and move it to your `TOMCAT_HOME/lib` folder.
- Set an environment variable to point to the Gson JAR file, allowing the application to handle JSON data.

## Notes

These steps are designed to set up all potential dependencies required across various advanced Java tasks. However, specific applications may not require every library or configuration listed here.
